# Hi there 👋

Below is a list of projects I built during high school and university. They span a wide range of areas, mobile development, web development, AI/ML, quantum computing, backend, and systems programming. Through this exploration phase, I realized that I want to pursue a career in backend development and server-side technologies.

## Here are some of my projects:

### Server side stuff
#### [VPN](https://github.com/misosvec/simple-vpn)
Simple VPN implemented in Go, including both client and server components. Built primarily for learning purposes to get hands-on experience with Golang, networking, and goroutines.

#### [BazosBot](https://github.com/misosvec/BazosBot)
Bot that automatically refreshes ads on an online marketplace, built with Flask (Python).

### Systems programming
#### [Cron](https://github.com/misosvec/cron)
A cron-like task scheduler written in C.

#### [Thread synchronization, Memory Allocator, Filesystem](https://github.com/misosvec/operating-systems-assignments/tree/main)
Assignments for Operating Systems course.

### AI/ML
#### [Explainable AI Malware Classification](https://github.com/misosvec/explainable-ai-malware-classificationhttps://github.com/misosvec/explainable-ai-malware-classification)
Master’s thesis focused on decision trees and neural networks in the field of malware analysis.

#### [Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/misosvec/ml-course-project/tree/main)
Final project for a machine learning course. Experimented with decision trees, boosting, bagging and BERT embeddings. 

### Web development
#### [Such A Spot](https://suchaspot.com/)
SEO optimized website developed using NextJS, Tailwind CSS and Supabase.

#### [Wordness - Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wordness-%E2%80%93-translate-lear/goolpoccdmciihfofigkfnmiigikmcno?hl=en)
A Chrome extension that allows users to select foreign words on websites, save them, and review them later in a mobile app using a spaced repetition technique.

### Mobile development
#### [SingleRowCalendar](https://github.com/misosvec/SingleRowCalendar)
Open source library for Android development written it Kotlin. So far, it has gained over 380 GitHub stars. No longer mantained.

#### [Wordness - Android App](https://apkpure.net/wordness-%E2%80%93-build-your-vocabulary-effectively/com.wordness.wordness)
App for selecting words on websites and then learning them using spaced repetition technique. I won a 3rd place at a nationwide high school competition in IT category with this project (app + extension). 

#### [What Is My Name](https://m.apkpure.com/ako-sa-vol%C3%A1m-n%C3%A1jdite-meno-pre-b%C3%A1b%C3%A4tko/com.bebee.akosavolam)
